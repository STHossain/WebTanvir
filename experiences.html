                        <li>Theoretical development of high dimensional time series models and their application to model dynamic networks.</li>

                        Fitting high dimensional models with fast and stable algorithms.

                        </li>

                        </ul>

                        <p> Motivation to work in this area came after I took some courses on high dimensional statistics and machine learning. My current tasks include understanding high dimensional time series models. In particular, theoretical details, proof techniques and exploring further development. With the theoretical work we also need an efficient way or algorithm to fit the models with data sets. That explains the other part of my tasks, which is the fitting problem. I mostly use  <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">R</font>. Occasionally I switch to <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">Python</font> for faster implementation. Current plan is to use <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">Rcpp</font> package in <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">R</font>.</p>

                        <p> Here my tasks were mostly related to data cleaning and data preparation for different development projects. They were:</p>

                        <ul>
                        
                        <li> Cleaning and then transforming raw data sets that we used to receive directly from paper/telephone surveys, so PIs could start analysis as quickly as possible. 

                        <li>
                        Running basic analysis or checks, e.g: fitting simple OLS, checking significance levels and producing plots/tables.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        Proof-reading different works from the chair, in particular draft version of journal or working papers, on-line documents and browse for relevant literatures.

                        </ul>

                        <p>For small implementation I used <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">STATA</font> and for medium to large implementations sometimes I switched to <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">Python</font>. Almost all the projects which I have been involved are still in working progress. Here is a IZA discussion paper ("Discussion Paper No. 9207") from one of the projects that I was involved with.</p>
